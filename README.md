# Stanford CS193p iOS Development Course

This repository contains my completed assignments from Stanford's public course (CS193p iOS Application Development course). The course focused on developing iOS applications using SwiftUI and emphasizes the MVVM architecture pattern.

## ðŸŽ¯ Course Overview

The course progression followed a hands-on approach, building increasingly complex applications:
- Started with a basic card-matching game (Memorize)
- Advanced to implementing Set (a complex card game)
- Culminated in building feature-rich applications with animations and persistent storage
